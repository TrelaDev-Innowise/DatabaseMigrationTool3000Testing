# Database Migration Tool 3000 - Testing

This project serves as a testing example for the **Database Migration Tool 3000**. It contains the necessary SQL migration files and a sample PostgreSQL database setup to test the functionality of the migration tool.

## üìã Requirements
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java JDK 17+** (required for running the migration tool)
- **Docker** (for running the PostgreSQL database in a container)
- **Maven 3.6+** (to build and manage dependencies of the project)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup

This project is built using **Maven** and contains a test class that demonstrates how to use the **Database Migration Tool 3000**.

### Steps to Set Up:

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DatabaseMigrationTool3000Testing.git
    cd DatabaseMigrationTool3000Testing
    ```

2. **Install Database Migration Tool 3000** (if not already installed):
   - Either install the tool by building it from the source and installing it in your local Maven repository, or you can use it directly from the JAR file.
   - Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/your-repo/DatabaseMigrationTool3000) for setting it up.

3. **Run the project using Docker Compose**:
   The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file that sets up a PostgreSQL database, which is pre-configured to work with the connection details provided in the `Main.java` file.

   - Make sure Docker is installed and running.
   - Run the following command to start the database:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

4. **Open the project in an IDE** (Recommended: **IntelliJ IDEA**):
   - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or any other Java IDE).
   - If you haven't installed the **Database Migration Tool 3000**, you can do so by adding it as a dependency in your `pom.xml` or by running the JAR file.

5. **Run the migration test**:
   - In your IDE, run the `Main.java` class.
   - This will attempt to connect to the PostgreSQL database running via Docker and run the SQL migrations found in the `src/main/resources/migrations` folder.

## üìù Migration Files

The migration files are located in the `src/main/resources/migrations` directory. They include sample SQL migration scripts that cover:
- **One-to-One** relationships
- **One-to-Many** relationships
- **Many-to-Many** relationships

These migration scripts will be applied sequentially to the database when you run the project, demonstrating how the tool handles schema changes and migration history.

## üöÄ Running the Migration

To run the migration tool and apply the migrations to the database, you can either:

- **Run directly from the JAR**:
   Once the **Database Migration Tool 3000** is installed, you can run the migration tool using the JAR file with the appropriate connection parameters (PostgreSQL database credentials).

- **Run from your IDE**:
   - Open the `Main.java` file in your IDE.
   - Ensure the PostgreSQL database is running (via Docker).
   - Run the class, and it will execute the migrations using the provided database credentials (`jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mymigrationtooldb`).


## üß™ Testing the Migration

Once the PostgreSQL database is set up and running, the migration tool will apply the migration files in the order they are listed. This ensures that the changes made in each migration are applied sequentially.

## üìà Logs and Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the logs in the terminal for potential errors. Common issues may include:

- **Database connection issues**: Make sure the credentials match those in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Migration file format errors**: Ensure migration files follow the correct naming convention.

## üß© Summary

This project provides an example of how to use the **Database Migration Tool 3000** to manage database migrations for PostgreSQL. It includes a sample test database setup with Docker and a set of migration files demonstrating different database relationships. The project can be run either through Docker and the command-line interface or directly from your IDE.

Enjoy using the **Database Migration Tool 3000** for PostgreSQL!
